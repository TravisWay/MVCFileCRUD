This Family Tree CRUD project was created by Travis Way.

This application lets the user add, delete, search and view their family tree.

This application utilizes Java, Spring, Maven, HTML, CSS, and JSP to run.

I would like to add functionality for multiple marriage families and just more branching in general

Setting up the branches and tree structure were the hardest part of this webAPP.
